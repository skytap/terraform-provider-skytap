# Skytap Provider

The Skytap provider is used to interact with the resources supported by Skytap.
The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

A typical provider configuration will look something like:

```hcl
provider "skytap" {
  username = "${var.skytap_username}"
  api_token = "${var.skytap_api_token}"
}

resource "skytap_environment" "env" {
	# ...
}
```
